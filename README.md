Project completed during study the "Web development using Python" course in IT-Academy.

Made with Django web-framework.

I used also it as "code playground" for new technologies I studied (websockets, vue.js, etc.) as well.

I leave this repo as it was at the moment I presented this project as a result of my study. So, many things don't work or work not as one can expect.
